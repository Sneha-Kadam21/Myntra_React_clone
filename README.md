## Overview
The **Myntra React Clone** replicates the look and feel of the Myntra e-commerce platform. The project demonstrates:

- **Component-based architecture** for reusable UI elements.
- **Props & State** for data passing and dynamic rendering.
- **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state and side effect management.
- **React Router** for page navigation.
- Responsive and modern **UI design**.

This project is an excellent example of applying React fundamentals to a real-world e-commerce frontend.
